### What is this repository for? ###

* Julia library for reading (and hopefully writing?) FIT files generated by Garmin GPS devices. 

* v0.0.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* Cloning this repository will allow using GarminFIT "locally" (i.e. using `include` and absolute function paths). Using `Pkg.clone("git@github.com:jgoldfar/GarminFIT.jl.git")` (from the official github repo) should allow you to put `using GarminFIT` at the top of your script and use the interface more easily.

* To contribute, please make an issue or pull request.
